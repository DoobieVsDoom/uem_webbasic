			<h2>Primary Objectives</h2>

		</div>
		<div class="boxA">
			<p>Mobilise the South African black majority to buy from their own. Whether you are in the suburbs, townships, rural areas or CBD's, try to buy from black businesses. We have presence in all provinces and since black South Africans make up the largest demographic group, we will not be apologetic about it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="boxB">
			<p>Develop presence in all provinces within Suburbs, Townships, Rural Areas and CBD's. The Township Economy has become a household phrase in South Africa but we need more than that. We will equip our people with skills so that factories can be re-established and land can be cultivated.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="boxC">
			<p>Successfully induct 1 Million black South Africans, being the largest demographic, into the business network for black South Africans. Let us create black owned South African brands and products and distribute them to black owned establishments, as well as support black service providers.</p>
