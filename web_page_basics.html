			<p class="intro">The primary objective of Umnotho Ebantwini Movement (UEM) is to mobilise the South African black majority to BUY FROM THEIR OWN. Whether you are in the suburbs, townships, rural areas or CBD's, try to buy from black businesses. We have presence in all provinces and since black South Africans make up the largest demographic group, we will not be apologetic about it. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="body"> The Township Economy has become a household phrase in South Africa but we need more than that. We will equip our people with skills so that factories can be re-established and land can be cultivated and developed, thus, creating employment opportunities and wealth for our people. This will encourage people to work harder and be innovative in all sectors. If we are focusing on the Township Economy only, we will end up derailing from this brilliant movement. The Township Economy is a low hanging fruit, yes, and we are encouraging people to organise themselves and start looking for strategic sites.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="outro">The principle behind the slogan BUY FROM YOUR OWN, whether it be goods or services, has already created thousands of billionaires in countries that abide by this principle and practice. BUY FROM YOUR OWN is mentioned in the presentations we make and during smobilisation on the ground to constantly remind South Africans that through this principle, this movement and unity can transform the economy of this country. Let us create black owned South African brands and products and distribute them to black owned establishments, as well as support black service providers.</p>
